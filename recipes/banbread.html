        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 to 3 medium (7" to 7<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>" long) very ripes bananas, peeled 
                    (about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups mashed)
                </li>
                <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
                <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>
                    <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup (150g) sugar (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup if you would like 
                    it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)
                </li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit, and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</li>
                <li>
                    In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir
                    the melted butter into the mashed bananas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract.
                    Mix in the flour.
                </li>
                <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.</li>
                <li>
                    Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350 degrees fahrenheit, or until a toothpick or wooden
                    skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of 
                    wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet;
                    loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from
                    the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make
                    slides that aren't crumbly.)
                </li>
            </ol>
